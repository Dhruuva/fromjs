# from.js
from.js is a super fast, well-optimized LINQ engine for JavaScript.

## Features
* **High-performance**
* Supports most LINQ functions that .NET provides
* 100% lazy evaluation
* Supports lambda expression

## Supported platforms
* Web (working)
* node.js

## Currently being migrated from CodePlex
This project is currently on working on migration from http://fromjs.codeplex.com/
You can reference documents at the site to get information about from.js, but before doing so, you have to be notified that several things have been changed.

* now can be installed with `npm install fromjs`
* `require('./from');` → `var from = require('fromjs');` on node.js
* *$from(something)* → *from(something)*
* *$empty()* → *from()*
* *$range(1, 10, 2)* → *from.range(1, 10, 2)*
* aggregate() and aggregateSeed() were united into aggregate()
* groupBy(), groupBy2(), groupBy3(), groupBy4() were united into groupBy()

Reference documents will be migrated and updated to here soon.

## Simple example

Below is an node.js example that print 10 prime numbers bigger than *n*. How simple it is! ;)

```javascript
var from = require('fromjs');

function isPrime(n) {
    return n == 2 ||
        !from.range(3, n, 2).takeWhile('$ * $ <= @', n).any('@ % $ == 0', n);
}

var n = 1000000;

if (n % 2 == 0) {
    ++n;
} else {
    n += 2;
}

from.range(n, Infinity, 2).where('@($)', isPrime).take(10).each('console.log($)');
```
